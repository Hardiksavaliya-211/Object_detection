Object Detection Project ðŸ’»ðŸ’»

ðŸ“” Overview :

This repository contains code and resources for an object detection project using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The project aims to detect and localize objects within images or videos using pre-trained models and custom datasets.

ðŸŒŸ Features:

Object detection and localization in images or videos.
Integration with pre-trained models such as YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN.
Training custom object detection models on user-defined datasets.
Evaluation metrics for model performance assessment.
Visualization tools for annotated images and model predictions.
